v0.0.1

A typewriter for the terminal. One character at a time, no editing, no backspace, no rewind.

== Why

Sometimes the inner editor needs to shut up. Rash forces forward motion: you type, it writes, that's it. Good for morning pages, freewriting, or any practice where the point is to keep going.

== Install

You'll need Python 3. Then:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

== Usage

```
rash outfile.txt
```

Type away. Ctrl+D or Ctrl+C to finish.

== Options

`-l, --length N`::
  Stop after N characters.

`-m, --minutes N`::
  Stop after N minutes.

`-c, --click-interval N`::
  Play a click sound every N characters (default: 50).

`-t, --timestamp-interval N`::
  Insert a timestamp every N characters (default: 1000).

`-p, --prompt TEXT`::
  Show a prompt below the cursor. Can be repeated; prompts rotate on each timestamp.

`-C, --center`::
  Display the current character centered on screen.

`-q, --quiet`::
  No sounds.

== Examples

Timed 10-minute session:
```
rash -m 10 morning.txt
```

750 words (roughly 3750 chars) with rotating prompts, quiet:
```
rash -l 3750 -q -p "keep going" -p "don't stop" -p "what else?" draft.txt
```

Centered, meditative mode:
```
rash -C -c 1 journal.txt
```
